# each jpg is a screen shot of the program running given the corresponding observation with "sys_in" variable is the input
# hand_calc.jpg is the hand calculation

## when taking the screenshot, the observation chain is hard coded in as a sys_in variable for easy to test purpose.
## now the program takes commandline input

## the input should be a chine like "HHSSHH" with H indicate as happy and S indicates sad
